# RunARoute
Software utilizing OpenStreetMap Data to generate routes automatically based on user-prescribed parameters.

# Purpose
There are few services that currently allow for the automatic creation of running routes that can be exported to running watches. This software will aim to allow users to describe parameters for the run route in the area of their choosing, such that routes that closely match these criteria can be created relatively easily.
